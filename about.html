            <h2>Story About Our Coffee Shop</h2>

            <p>
                At LUNARE Café, we started with a simple idea: every cup of coffee should
                feel warm, personal and special. We carefully choose our beans, roast them
                in small batches and prepare each drink with attention so you can enjoy
                rich flavor and a cozy café feeling wherever you are.
            </p>

                We loved this experience so much that we decided to bring it online.  
                Our website and app are designed to make ordering easier and faster for you:
                you can explore the menu, customize your drink, choose your favorite beans,
                and place your order from home or on the go – without waiting in line.
                You can also schedule pickup or delivery at the time that suits you best.
                LUNARE Café is here to help you relax, study or work while we take care of
                the coffee.
